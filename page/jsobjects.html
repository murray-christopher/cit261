  <h1>Javascript Objects</h1>
  <h2>Object Creation & Instantion</h2>
  <p>Objects can be thought of as an a real life object and its description.
    Such as a ball that has a shape, color, texture, and material. A Balls object would look like this:<br/><br/>
    var ball = {<br/>
      &emsp;shape: "Sphere",<br/>
      &emsp;color: "red",<br/>
      &emsp;texture: "smooth",<br/>
      &emsp;material: "rubber"<br/>
    };<br/><br/>
    On the left is the property and the right is the value. With this you can
    gather input from the user about a anything and store it as an object
    that I can then use to customise the user experience. Another Form of this
    is to make a funtion with parameter and call the function and pass in the
    parameters which can save time if your making a lot of these objects and be
    cleaner.</p>

  <h2>Properties</h2>
  <p>Properties of a object are the key words that define the value. Since objects
    describe something we use keywords as the desciptions. Which this was can
    have metadata for values. Giving values identifiers can make things really
    easy for other to integrate with your code.</p>

  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <p>These are functions that are specific to an object. For instance you have
    in your object first name and last name but in your code you want to display
    thier full name often. Rather than typing out allthe syntax and conjuctions
    we can make a method that return that value and call the method name. So the
    call would be object.name instead of "object.firstname + ' ' + object.lastname"
    which is a lot shorter especially if you need the middle name too.</p>

  <h2>Inheritance</h2>
  <p>Inheritence in javascript is different than compiled languages. It is
    refered to as prototyping. Javascript has a predefined library for different
    objects which are at the top of the food chain of objects. One of those is
    the default object which is where custom objects inherit from. </p>
  <p>To create/start your our custom library of objects known as prototypes you
    must first create an object constructor or temple in which the other objects
    will be made after.</p>
  <p>This might just seem like a lot of extra work to make objects but the benefit
    to prototyping is methods for objects of a certian type. for instance you
    can create the ovedrloaded display function for your object in which later
    in your code you then just call object.display and it will display your object
    correctly and you won't have to write in a lot of different places. You can
    also write your own merge function between objects and copy and all sorts of
    extra functionality to your objects making it easier to work with and read.</p>
