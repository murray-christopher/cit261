  <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>

  <h2>Loops</h2>
    <div id="loops" ></div>
    <input type="button" value="count to 10" onclick="forloop()">
    <input type="button" value="reset" onclick="forloopreset()">

  <h2>Conditionals</h2>
  <p>Input some text or leave blank and click test. Using conditionals I can
    display custom alerts to notify you of what you entered or that you didn't
    enter anything.</p>
  <input type="text" id="conditional">
  <input type="button" value="test" onclick="conditional()">

  <h2>Functions</h2>
  <p>click some of the buttons below to execute the functions I have under
    different categories</p>
    <input type="button" value="Execute Conditional" onclick="conditional()">
    <input type="button" value="Execute Loop" onclick="forloop()">

  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p>With declared Variables I can grab information from the client store it in a
    varible and Manipulate it. Enter text below and it will tell you how long your text input is.</p>
    <input type="text" id="variable">
    <input type="button" value="test" onclick="variable()">

  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  <p>Parameters are variables passed through a function header. Whenever the
    function is called you can pass it the variables it needs complete its
    task. The button below will call our variable function and pass it the
    parameter "test" which will give us a length of 4.</p>
    <input type="button" value="call with test" onclick="variable(test)">

  <h2>Objects</h2>
  <p>Objects can be thought of as an a real life object and its description.
    Such as a ball that has a shape, color, texture, and material. A Balls object would look like this:<br/><br/>
    var ball = {<br/>
      &emsp;shape: "Sphere",<br/>
      &emsp;color: "red",<br/>
      &emsp;texture: "smooth",<br/>
      &emsp;material: "rubber"<br/>
    };<br/><br/>
    On the left is the property and the right is the value. With this you can
    gather input from the user about a anything and store it as an object
    that I can then use to customise the user experience. I cover objects
    more in depth <a href="jsobjects.html">here</a></p>

  <h2>Arrays</h2>
  <p>Arrays are special types of objects. The main difference is that arrays
    do not need properties they are just a list of values. However they can
    store a list of object type and mixed datatypes just like objects, in
    which you can access using the dot operator or brackets to access elements.
    The next question you might ask is what one do you use where and why.<br/><br/>
    It comes down to good developer practices because you could get away with doing
    either one, however if your code calls for an array where your accessing
    positions in the object and looping through the values an array would be
    the better practice and make more sense. If your keeping track of a lot
    or objects that relate then an array that would be much better. More simply
    if its a list of related values I would use and array. If your trying to
    provide a description of something in code then use an object.<br/><br/>
    below is a list of values displayed when the page loads</p>
