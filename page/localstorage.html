  <h1>Local Storage</h1>
  <h2>Storing and Retrieving Simple Data</h2>
  <p>There are multiple ways in which you can store information from the user.<br><br>

  <strong>local storage</strong> - This is stored on the clients computer so the next time they
  access your site you can tell who they are and continue where they left off.
  However this storage is frowned upon and not very useful since most browsers
  will block this or the user them self will. It can be very useful when dealing
  with a lot of temporary data that is very critical. should the user lose
  internet the client can still be saving the work of the user "offline" to
  upload to the server when they become connected again<br><br>

  <strong>Cookies & sessions</strong> - These are both encrypted files that a website can use to
  customise your experience. Cookies are stored client side while sessions are
  stored server-side. Usually one is used over the other not usually used together,
  however there are very useful cases in which both can help. Cookies again are
  tough since the user can block them from websites using them, they are more
  secure that local storage but less than sessions.<br><br>

  Example of local storage can be found <a href="jsonparse.html">here<a/>.
  You can view the locally stored json in chrome by hitting f12 and navigating
  to the tab called application. it will appear after you have created a local
  variable which in my case in filling out the form and stringifying it.</p>
